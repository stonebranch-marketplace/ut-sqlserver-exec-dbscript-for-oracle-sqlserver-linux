# 2	Introduction

The here described Universal Task allows to execute an oracle PLSQL block or an SQLSERVER T-sql statement. It uses an agentless connection 
via ODBC towards SQLSERVER and the oracle basic instant client to connect to an Oracle database. The connection and execution of the sql 
statements is performed using the python cx_oracle and pyodbc modules. 
Some details about the universal task to monitor a value in a database column

- The Universal Task supports SQLSERVER & Oracle
- MySql and PostgreSQL can be added in the future
- The Universal Task supports both Universal Agent for Linux/Unix and Windows
- You can select different log-levels e.g. Info and debug
- You can execute oracle PLSQL blocks and SQLSERVER T-SQL statements
-	You can decide if the sql-output is provided in the standard out or not
- All Passwords are encrypted using Controller Credentials
